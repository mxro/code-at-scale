# Organisational Values

The [People Values](./people/) discussed in the previous section apply to direct interactions of people. _Organisational Values_ describes values that are adopted by the abstract entity of the organisation and that are not directly related to people interacting within the organisation.

While, as a leader, you usually have autonomy to shape the People Values for your own teams, organisational values are often more difficult to influence, especially if you are working within a larger organisation.

## Customer First

Organisations that value the wellbeing and satisfaction of their customers are often successful and are likely to make a positive contribution to society.

Note that while few would disagree that it is important to look after customers, the key aspect of this value is to put customers _first_. Putting customers first means that sometimes you have to sacrifice efficiency and profit.
